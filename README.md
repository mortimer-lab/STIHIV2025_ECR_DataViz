# STIHIV2025_ECR_DataViz
Resources for the Data Visualization Workshop at STI HIV 2025

## Software Requirements

This workshop requires [R](https://cran.rstudio.com/) (version >= 4.2). We also recommend [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/).

All scripts have been tested using R version 4.3.3.

Additionally, vizualizations will use the following R packages:
- [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/)
- [janitor](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/janitor/index.html)
- [stringi](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/stringi/index.html)
- [viridis](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/viridis/index.html)
- [cowplot](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cowplot/index.html)
- [ggpubr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggpubr/index.html)

## Setting Up Your Environment

### Installing packages

R packages can be installed using `install.packages()`. For example, to install tidyverse (which include dplyr, ggplot2, and several other common R packages), run `install.packages("tidyverse")`. You can also install packages through RStudio using the Tools dropdown menu

Packages only need to be installed once, but packages need to be loaded each time a script is run using the `library()` function (e.g. `library(tidyverse)`).

### Setting your working directory

You can set your working directory in RStudio in the Files pane in the bottom right corner using the More toolbar (with gear icon) and then "Set As Working Directory" or select the Session drop-down menu at the top of your screen and choose "Set Working Directory".


## data
Input data to use during workshop activities

### African_meningococci.csv
Sequence typing and metadata associated with *Neisseria meningitidis* isolates collected in Africa.

### CDC_STI_Surveillance_2023.csv
Table 1 from CDC's *Sexually Transmitted Surveillance, 2023*. The original table can be found here: [Table 1. Sexually Transmitted Infections â€” Reported Cases and Rates of Reported Cases*, United States](https://www.cdc.gov/sti-statistics/data-vis/table-sticasesrates.html)

### Mortimer2020_sexualbehavior_AMR.csv
